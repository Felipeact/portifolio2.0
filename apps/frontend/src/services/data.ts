I learned how to create dynamic UI components such as a health bar, energy bar, and ammo counter, and integrate them seamlessly into the viewport.",
            description2: "Learn how to build a dynamic HUD using Widget Blueprints in Unreal Engine. In this section, you’ll create a HUD Widget to visualize the character’s health and energy bars. You’ll use panels like Horizontal Box and Vertical Box, bind Progress Bars to character variables, and position the HUD neatly in the viewport.",
            description3: "Set up a second widget called HUD_AmmoCount to appear only when the character picks up a weapon. You’ll configure the BP_Rifle blueprint to trigger the widget and display real-time ammo and max ammo values, keeping your HUD clean and context-sensitive.",
            description4: "Connect your UI elements to game logic by binding Health, Energy, Ammo, and MaxAmmo variables from the BP_FirstPersonCharacter Blueprint. You'll learn how to cast the player character in the HUD widget and bind UI components to reflect live values during gameplay.",
            description5: "Integrate Blueprint scripting to control HUD functionality in response to gameplay events. Actions like jumping or taking damage will dynamically adjust the Energy and Health bars, while firing or reloading a weapon will update Ammo counts in real-time.",
